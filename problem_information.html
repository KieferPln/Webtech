<h1>Life Below Water</h1>

<p id="introduction"> 
The goal of this website is to provide information and resources about goal 14 of the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This goal, titled "Life Below Water", is to 'conserve and 
sustainably use the oceans, sea and marine resources for sustainable development'. <br>
<br>
On this website you'll find information on the problems we currently face with regards to oceans,
and which parties are stakeholders in these issues. Our focus is on policymakers and academics. For
this reason we included an agenda to upcoming conferences, symposia, and other events. Please feel
free to make an account and add events that interest you to your favorites. Also, if there is an
event you feel should be included in our agenda, please fill in this form <!--hier een link naar de
form--> with a link to the event. Besides an agenda, you'll find information on important
publications in the field of sustainable use, regeneration and other problems surrounding oceans.

<h3>Plastic pollution</h3>

<p>Due to an increase in plastic consumption and ineffective waste management strategies, more
plastic than ever is ending up in the ocean. Of all the waste that finds its way to the ocean, 85%
is plastic. In 2021, more than 17 million metric tons of plastic entered the ocean. Instead of
becoming less, this number is projected to <b>double or triple</b> by 2040.
Plastic in oceans form a great danger to marine life. Sea animals often mistake plastic for prey.
After eating the plastic they die from starvation as their stomachs become full with plastic.
Another danger for sea life is getting ensnared in the plastic waste, resulting in injury or death.
Besides these immediate dangers from plastic waste, large plastics eventually become microplastics.
The complete dangers of microplastics are still unknown, but it is clear that they find their way
into our food and water supplies, and eventually into our bodies.</p> <br>

<h3>Rising temperatures</h3>

<p>
Ocean temperatures are rising because they absorb the largest part of the excess energy and heat 
from greenhouse gas emissions. It is estimated that oceans have absorbed approxiamately 90% of
warmth created by increased emissions. This comes with several risks. First of all, rising ocean
temperature causes polar ice to melt, which in turn causes sea-levels to rise. Rising ocean levels
are a risk to coastal areas. This is caused by the increased chance of extreme events such as
coastal flooding, landslides and erosion. Not only the 2 billion people living in coastal areas are
at risk. All life in coastal areas is under threat from rising sea levels. Second, rising
temperatures also cause loss of marine biodiversity and damage to marine ecosystems in non-coastal
areas. The UN has estimated that 60% of marine ecosystems are currently being used in an
unsustainable way or are otherwise degrading. Even worse, they estimate that half of marine species
may be facing extinction by 2100. A prime example of rising temperatures causing damage to marine
ecosystems is the bleaching and eventual destruction of coral reefs. Currently, we stand at a
temperature increase of 1.1°C. An increased temperature of 1.5°C would cause the destruction of 70
to 90% of coral reefs. An even higher increase of 2°C would cause the disappearance of 99% of coral
reefs. At this point, there would be no way of reestablishing coral ecosystems. A third danger is
the increase of probability of marine heatwaves. These heatwaves compound the regular dangers of
rising ocean temperatures.

<h3>Eutrophication</h3>

<p>
Eutrophication occurs when nutrients are added to the environment. This is predominantly caused by
washout of agricultural fertilizers which are rich in phosphorus and nitrogen. Other possible causes
are sewage disposal and the intentional adding of nutrients to attract economically or
recreationally important marine species. These added nutrients cause an increase in algae and plant
growth in costal regions and estuaries (where fresh and salt water meet). When these
algae die, oxygen in the water is used to decompose the dead algae. Lack of oxygen leads to the
death of marine life and can cause so-called dead zones, places where the water contains little to
no life. An example of a dead zone is along the Gulf Coast of the United States. In 2021, this area
was 16.405 square kilometers. Another example is along the coast of Chili, where in 2016 23 million
dead salmon washed ashore. This was attributed to algae blooms, caused by eutrophication.
